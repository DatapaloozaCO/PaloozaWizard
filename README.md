# Datapalooza Web Scraper Framework

![Datapalooza Logo](img/rocket.png)

## Overview

The Datapalooza Web Scraper Framework is a powerful tool that allows users to create web scrapers with minimal effort. With just a URL as input, this framework generates a Python script that enables users to scrape data from a website of their choice.

## Features

- **Simplified Scraping:** Say goodbye to complex coding and configuration. You only need to provide the URL you want to scrape, and our framework takes care of the rest.

- **Automated Script Generation:** The framework automatically generates a Python script tailored to the specified URL, saving you time and effort.

- **Customization:** While we make scraping easy, you can still customize your scraper script to meet specific data extraction needs.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/datapalooza/web-scraper-framework.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the framework directory.

2. Run the following command, replacing `URL_TO_SCRAPE` with the website URL you want to scrape:

   ```shell
   python scraper.py URL_TO_SCRAPE
   ```

3. The framework will generate a Python script in the current directory, ready for you to use for scraping.

## Example

Let's say you want to scrape product data from "example.com". Here's how you can use our framework:

```shell
python scraper.py https://example.com
```

The framework will generate a Python script named `example_com_scraper.py`, which you can then execute to scrape data from "example.com."

## Customization

While the generated script provides a basic scraping setup, you can customize it to suit your needs. Add additional code for data processing or further scraping as required.
